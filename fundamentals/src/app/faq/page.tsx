    question: 'What is a kendama?',
    answer:
      "The kendama is an addictive wooden skill game. Invented over 100 years ago in Japan, it helps improve hand-eye coordination, balance, concentration, and reflexes. Plus, it's fun!",

    question: 'What are kendamas made from?',
    answer:
      'Traditionally, kendamas are carved from wood. In modern years, companies have also experimented with metal and plastic, though most kendamas are still made from wood.',
  },

    id: 'how-long-until-good',
    question: 'How long does it take to become good?',
    answer:
      'The kendama is a deceptively difficult toy to become proficient with. Most of the people you see doing amazing tricks in videos have been doing it for many, many years!',
  },
  {
    id: 'how-to-choose',
    question: 'How do I pick the right kendama for me?',
    answer:
      "Kendamas come in a wide array of designs, but for beginners, we recommend a plain wooden kendama. It's natural for the toy to get pretty banged up as you practice. Once you're more comfortable with the fundamentals, you can invest in a beautiful painted kendama.",
