# Polymorphism

In order to build usable, accessible interfaces, it's important 
that we understand the semantics of different HTML tags.

For example: if an element can be clicked to perform an action in JS, 
it should be a button! Unless that action is to navigate the user to 
a new page, in which case, it should be an anchor (<a>).

When choosing an HTML tag, it's much more important to focus on the semantics 
than the aesthetics. You should use a <button> even if you don't want it to look 
like a button. With CSS, we can strip away all of those built-in button styles. 
It's much easier to remove a handful of CSS rules than it is to recreate all of 
the usability benefits built into the <button> tag.
