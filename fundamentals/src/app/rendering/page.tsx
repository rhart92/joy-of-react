/**
 * In React, every state variables is attached to one and only one component
 * instance. In this Component tree, we have one piece of state `count` which is
 * associated with the `Counter` component. Whenever `count` changes, `Counter`
 * will re-render (not necessarily re-paint but re-render ü§î). Since
 * `BigCountNumber` is a descendant, it will be re-rendered too.
 *
 * TODO: Build the re-render flashing app shown at https://courses.joshwcomeau.com/joy-of-react/03-hooks/08.01-why-react-renders
 * It's interesting.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Remember: React's ‚Äúmain job‚Äù is to keep the application UI in sync with the
 * React state. The point of a re-render is to figure out what needs to change.
 *
 * When the user clicks the button in `Counter`, React needs to figure out what
 * the new "picture" of the DOM we want. It does this by re-running the code in
 * `Counter` and `BigCountNumber` because it's a child of `Counter`. This
 * picture tell us "what the UI _should_ look like based on the current state of
 * the application".
 *
 * React then plays "find the difference" game to figure out what changed
 * betwen the snapshots (i.e pictures). In our case it notices that the text
 * node in the paragraph changed from 0 -> 1 and so it edits the text node in
 * the DOM. Now react waits for the next state change. This is the "React Core
 * Loop".
 *
 * The point of a re-render is to figure out how a state change should affect
 * the user interface. And so we need to re-render all potentially-affected
 * components, to get an accurate snapshot.

 * `Decoration` depends on count directly or indirectly.
 *
 * In an ideal world, React components would always be ‚Äúpure‚Äù. A pure component
 * is one that always produces the same UI when given the same props. Even just
 * using something like `Date.now()` will make your component impure. Refs are
 * another sneaky version of this problems since refs can't be checked if they
 * changed by object reference since they are mutated. So... React airs on the
 * side of caution and sacrafices performance.
 *
 * React's #1 goal is to make sure that the UI that the user sees is kept ‚Äúin
 * sync‚Äù with the application state. And so, React will err on the side of too
 * many renders. It doesn't want to risk showing the user a stale UI.
